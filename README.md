Fig. 1. A demo of maximum slope truncation (MST) strategy. The slope computed from a pre-trained ArcFace network is called Identity Slope. The first order derivative of a cosine-based function is called Editing Slope. MST finds A and D, which have maximum absolute slope values. Its corresponding editing interval is (LA, RD). is a step size for image editing. Image artifacts are labeled with a red box in poorly edited images.
